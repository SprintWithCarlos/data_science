    "# TL;DR How to use Python to generate a graph based on the Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Measurement (hereinafter PSM).\n",
    "## Prerequisite: The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the Van Westendorp chart, you only need a dataset from a survey with the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the price that would make you refrain from buying the product because is too expensive?\n",
    "* At what price do you consider that you would buy the product even if it seems expensive to you?\n",
    "* At what price would you buy it even if you consider it cheap?\n",
    "* What would be the price at which you would consider it too cheap to the point of doubting its quality and stop buying it?\n",
    "\n",
    "The table should have 4 columns:  \n",
    "\n",
    "        | Too Cheap | Cheap  | Expensive |  Too Expensive |\n",
    "        | --------- | ------ | --------- | -------------- |\n",
    "        |     1     |    2   |     3     |       4        |\n",

    "To generate the Van Westendorp chart, you must add your file to this directory. It accepts csv, json, and excel files.\n",

    "\n",
    "---- \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dataset where respondents answer prices \"too cheap\", \"cheap\", \"expensive\" and \"too expensive\" for the product under study:\n",
    "* We use `pandas` library to transform the content of the survey file into a data frame. We add two new columns: \n",
    "  - one called \"CPer\" with the cumulative relative frequency of the dataset indexes + 1, and\n",
    "  - other called \"Inverse CPer\" which equals 1 - CPer of each entry\n",
    "* With that information using `matplotlib` library we plot the lines:\n",
    "  - \"too cheap\" and \"cheap\" that will have negative slope, while\n",
    "  - \"expensive\" and \"too expensive\" that will have positive slope (More about this later)\n",
    "* We find the four intersections and label them according to their corresponding value:\n",
    "  - Intersection of \"too cheap\" and \"too expensive\" is the Optimal Price Point (OPP)\n",
    "  - Intersection of \"too cheap\" and \"expensive\" is the Point of Marginal Cheapness (PMC)\n",
    "  - Intersection of \"cheap\" and \"too expensive\" is the Point of Marginal Expensiveness (PME), and \n",
    "  - Intersection of \"cheap\" and expensive\" is the Indifference Point(IP)\n",
    "* Finally we append (add below the chart) a block of text to indicate the value of the interceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are only interested in using the code, just add your survey file to this directory and follow the instructions in the following cell.\n",

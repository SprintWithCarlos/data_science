Identifying the keystone habit is important to make the transformation process easier. Examples of keystone habits include fitness, reading books, and changing sleeping habits. To stay motivated, celebrate small successes and keep track of progress. Short form is a great service that offers hundreds of book guides, and can help with identifying keystone habits. Lastly, I wish everyone a successful year!\n## Main Takeaways:\n  1. Everyone experiences failure and makes resolutions every year, but rarely accomplish them. Last year I changed my approach by breaking the cycle of regret and actually working on the things that mattered to me. I identified problems and worked on bad habits one by one. Change is hard, but by establishing a routine and building the required habits, we can get used to the pain of discipline. This video is aimed at helping people start their journey towards change.\n  2. When we decide to change our habits, rushing to transform them drastically is not the best way. The most efficient way is by finding your keystone habit, which is the one habit that is more important than others and is correlated with other good habits. For example, for me fitness is the keystone habit that puts the rest of my life in place. To build a consistent fitness habit, I suggest setting realistic goals, tracking progress, making it enjoyable, and rewarding yourself.\n  3.  - I struggled with finding an exercise program and feeling confident in my own skin, but then I discovered a workout program called Evolve You. The app makes it easy to track progress, schedule workouts, and find different types of exercises you might enjoy. It's important to find something you like so you can be consistent. Lifting weights can be intimidating at first, but once you learn the movements and correct your form, you will start to see progress.\n  4. In order to gain confidence at the gym, it is important to find a comfortable and good-looking activewear that makes you feel empowered. Starting small with low risk exercises is also beneficial in order to get used to the gym environment. Lastly, it is important to avoid comparing your progress to others and instead focus on improving yourself.\n  5. To stay motivated, it is important to regularly enjoy small successes. This means focusing less on the gap between where you are and where you want to be, and more on achieving what you set out to do each day. By celebrating small victories and savoring them, you can begin to feel accomplished every day. It may not always be easy to get started, as the first step in any process can be the hardest, but once you push through the initial difficulty, it will become easier to maintain motivation and progress.\n  6.  Reading books can help you to learn new ideas and perspectives, widen your vision, and help with struggles such as productivity or handling money. Through reading books, you can have access to the knowledge of successful people for a relatively inexpensive price. Reading books can help you to challenge yourself and remind you of your goals.\n  7. Short form is a great service that offers hundreds of book guides. It allows you to get key ideas from a book before investing your time and money in reading it, so you can minimize the chance of reading books that are not suitable for you. Additionally, they drop new book guides and articles every week. I recently read How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie on short form and will make a video about it. If you join through the link shortform.com or use the link down description below, you will get a five day unlimited access and an additional 20 off discount on annual membership. Instead of using YouTube videos as a way to procrastinate, use them as inspiration and write down what you learn, then actually do it the next day.\n  8. I struggled with sleep for years, and it wasn't until I hit rock bottom that I realized I needed to take action. To change my sleeping habits, I identified why I was struggling to wake up early. I learned that there is a name for this phenomenonrevenge bedtime procrastination. To combat this, I started cutting out leisure activities like Netflix and social media late at night and replaced them with restful activities such as reading. This has allowed me to get better sleep, be more productive during the day, and keep up with my daily responsibilities.\n  9.  My go-to way of taking a break from my busy schedule was scrolling on my phone endlessly until I fell asleep. One day, when reading the book The Power of Habits, I learned that habits consist of a cue, routine and reward. To change a habit, you must keep the old cue, deliver the old reward, and insert a new routine. In my case, my cue was going to bed, my routine was grabbing my phone and scrolling, and my reward was consuming content and getting a spike of dopamine. To fix this problem, I decided to swap out the routine of grabbing my phone for grabbing my Kindle instead and created a charging station far away from my bed. I also bought an alarm clock to prevent night and morning time scrolling. Curing the revenge bedtime procrastination was the keystone habit for me, making it easier to sleep and wake up earlier.\n  10.  - The calls are \"I hope you enjoyed this video\" and \"I wish you guys a very successful year\".\n  \n"}]},{"source":"## Optional\nIf you would like to make a summary in a language other than English, you can do so by replacing \"target_language\" with your selection in the following cell.\nExample:\n```python\nlanguage = 'es' # use \"es\" for Spanish, \"fr\" for French...\n```","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"74ca316c-c356-4228-a02a-00e84064df46"},{"source":"url = \"your_url\"\nlanguage = 'es'\n%run summarize/summary.py\nsummarize(url, language)","metadata":{"executionTime":517,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"url = \"your_url\"\nlanguage = 'es'\n%run summarize/summary.py\nsummarize(url, language)"},"cell_type":"code","id":"7c9756fd-5811-4a24-8865-c8b4fbbb3022","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"editor":"DataCamp Workspace"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}

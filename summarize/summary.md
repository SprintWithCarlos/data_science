## Executive Summary:


Microsoft's Power Platform is the most widely used low code application platform, and 97% of Fortune 500 companies are using it. Low code is becoming increasingly important for organizations to invest in and provide skill-building initiatives for their workforce. Microsoft has resources such as adoption.microsoft.com and Power Up Program to help with scaling and skilling. Examples of successful rollouts at companies like H&M, Telstra, Accenture, and Schlumberger include creating managed communities, fostering a culture of creativity, innovatin, personalization, and fun, providing certifications, creating a development community through Yammer, and establishing a Power Suite. This fusion model of digital cells working with pro-code teams provides high user satisfaction and fulfills the requirements.
## Main Takeaways:
  1. Ryan Cunningham, leader of the Power Apps team at Microsoft, discussed how organizations can use low code to scale and skill their workforce. Gartner predicts that 70% of enterprise software will be developed in low code by 2025. Microsoft's Power Platform is the most widely used low code application platform on the planet. 97% of Fortune 500 companies are using it and 175 of those companies have 10,000 or more people using just Power Apps every month.
  2.  Low code is becoming more popular and its expected from companies to invest in the technology, as well as provide technical skills for their workforce. Additionally, there are three converging trends that are coming together due to low code; digital transformation, trust, and compliance/security. All of these elements must be taken into consideration when looking at the future of low code.
  3. Organizations are facing a tight labor market for technical talent, as well as digital transformation and trust challenges. Low-code technology provides a way to solve these issues by making it easier to roll out software without needing a new team of software engineers for every problem. Microsoft is invested in making this process easier, with resources like adoption.microsoft.com providing helpful content to get started.
  4. This content provides a framework for thinking about scaling low code across a company. It starts with securing the environment and engaging early adopters, then focuses on skills building and increasing engagement. Microsoft has recently implemented new governance features, such as Managed Environments for Power Platform, which provide visibility and control with minimal effort.
  5. Power Apps is rolling out new product capabilities to help with the foundation of their platform. These capabilities include an integrated virtual agent, connected to the champions and maker community, to provide conversational interfaces and help with documentation. This helps people find the right skills for their problems and creates a cycle of human help in addition to AI-driven and automated tools.
  6. Power Apps Studio provides a virtual assistant to help makers learn and build skills. The Power Up program is providing intensive multi-week training courses with certifications for anyone who applies. Through the virtual agent, makers can also access knowledge bases of documentation and content and connect with people in their company for extra help. All of these features are available in-product, allowing makers to become advisors and be recognized for their skill.
  7. Ryan Boggs, CVP of Microsoft Power Platform, discussed how to build successful applications and plug talent into the Power Up program. April Dunnam, Principal Cloud Advocate, then discussed scaling and skilling within organizations, starting with building a diverse community of over 2.8 million monthly active users and 500 independent user groups worldwide.
  8. Organizations are having success with scaling and skilling internally by creating managed communities and grassroots efforts, fostering a culture of creativity, innovatin, personalization, and fun. Examples include H&M's yammer group and Sharepoint site, as well as Telstra's Power Factory newsletter.
  9. Karen Odegaard, the Managing Director of Technology Platforms at Accenture, talked about how they tackled scaling and skilling with their low code community. She mentioned that it was important to have executive sponsorship for successful rollouts of internal scaling programs. To upskill, they promote certification, campaigns and hackathons, and provide tools, schools and rules for power platform development.
  10. Karen Odegaard, from Accenture, discussed the ways in which the company has provided skill-building initiatives to its developers. These include providing certifications, creating a development community through Yammer, and establishing a Power Suite that connects developers to the most senior members of the team. Additionally, Accenture created a Use Case Review Board in order to ensure that all applications built are properly aligned with organizational strategy and governance, such as legal and data privacy considerations.
  11. Karen Odegaard from Accenture shared how her company has approached skilling on Power Platform. She discussed how they created a governance board to assess use cases and maintain their level of governance while still allowing users to create their own applications within the ecosystem. H&M Global Retail Company is an example of a company that is making sure everyone can become a software innovator, while keeping it safe and responsible. They are managing it centrally.
  12. :I applied for an internship with Schlumberger in 2018. Alan asked if I had ever used power apps or power bi and I replied that I only knew PowerPoint. Five hours later, I got the job offer and it changed my life. Now I'm the HR digital cell lead at Schlumberger and have been able to use the skills I've gained to help build the business.
  13. Georgia spent four years with Schlumberger, growing in experience and skill from intern to digital analyst to digital cell lead. She learned all about the power platform from her mentor Alan, and applied it to help create a COVID-19 app in three hours during the pandemic. Through online training, virtual training, hackathons, and more, she has helped train over 40 HSE and HR professionals in the use of power platform.
  14. I helped Alan create a crisis communication app for Schlumberger in 20 hours. The app was quickly adopted and reached 50,000 users in a short period of time. It is now available in 10 languages and has features such as vaccination information. Low code and the power platform enabled us to quickly adapt to ever-changing pandemic conditions. Alan will now discuss Schlumberger’s digital strategy.
  15. :Schlumberger started their journey with Power Platform in 2018 and now have 8,000 citizen makers, 27,000 power apps and 47,000 cloud flows. These digital tasks used to be done manually but are now automated, leading to 4 million transactions per day. They implemented a Digital Delivery Layer called Digital Cells, which consists of dedicated resources embedded in the business. These resources are trained in low code such as Power Platform to solve business challenges. This model was designed to encourage innovation at the edge of the business.
  16. Georgia and Alan have described a process for identifying scenarios suitable for low code solutions. This process involves a decision tree that guides users to determine whether the scenario is suitable for self-service by citizen developers, or should it go to dedicated digital cells, or should it go to digital studio to handle more complex solutions. A new model of partnership between digital cell and the studio has been put in place, where the business team, the digital cell, and the pro-code team work together on the solution. The digital cell gathers the requirements, discusses with architects, and works with UX designers, technical architects, and security teams to secure data access. The app is then deployed to the intended audience. This fusion model has been found to be very effective, providing high user satisfaction and fulfilling the requirements.
  17. Companies like H&M, Telstra, Accenture and Schlumberger have successfully applied a framework for driving innovation that can be replicated by other organizations. This framework involves creating a secure foundation, identifying champions and early adopters, and scaling the new application to the whole organization. Through resources such as Power Up Program and various training courses, individuals can get plugged into this larger community of innovators and create great things in the next few years.

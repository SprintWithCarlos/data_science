## Executive Summary:
Data science professionals should use separate datasets for inspiration and rigor, and have statisticians outside the group that has an incentive to launch a machine learning system. This can prevent confirmation bias and strategic persuasion with data. Stakeholders in different levels of the organization should be involved in decision-making.
## Main Takeaways:
  1. Data science professionals should remember that a datapoint can be used for inspiration or for rigor, but not both. To prevent confirmation bias, analysts and statisticians should work with separate datasets. The decision-maker should then decide which patterns in the analyst's dataset are worth opening the secret stash of data to ensure that the question fits the patterns in the dataset.
  2. It is important to have statisticians working outside of the group that has an incentive to launch a machine learning system. This way, they can check the analyst insights and make sure that the data being presented is accurate. They can also check whether the machine learning system is worth launching. Having stakeholders in different levels of the organization can help delegate decision-making and prevent any strategic persuasion with data.

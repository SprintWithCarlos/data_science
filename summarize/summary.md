## Executive Summary:
Data scientists should split their data into two datasets, one for inspiration and one for rigor. The dataset used for rigor should be left in escrow until a decision-maker reviews the potential insights. Statisticians should also be consulted to check the system, analyst's insights and make sure that no deceptive data is being used. This is important when strategic persuasion with data is involved.
## Main Takeaways:
  1. Data scientists should split their data into two datasets, one that is used for inspiration and one that is used for rigor. The dataset used for inspiration should be handed to the analysts, while the dataset used for rigor should be left in escrow until a decision-maker has looked at the potential insights from the analysts and decides to open the secret stash of data. This way, there is trust in the patterns found within the dataset, and decisions can be made with confidence.
  2. Testing is very important in machine learning and it is wise to have statisticians outside of the group that creates the machine learning system. They should be able to check the system, analyst's insights and make sure that there is no deceptive data being used. This is especially important when strategic persuasion with data is involved.
